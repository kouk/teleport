// Workpool
//
// The `Pool` type functions as a means of managing the number of concurrent workers,
// grouped by key.  You can think of this type as functioning
// like a collection of semaphores, except that multiple distinct resources may
// exist (distinguished by keys), and the target concurrent worker count may
// change at runtime.  The basic usage pattern is as follows:
//
// 1. The desired number of workers for a given key is specified
// or updated via Pool.Set.
//
// 2. Workers are spawned as leases become available on Pool.Acquire.
//
// 3. Workers relenquish their leases when they finish their work
// by calling Lease.Release.
//
// 4. New leases become available as old leases are relenquished, or
// as the target concurrent lease count increases.
//
// This is a generalization of logic originally written to manage the number
// of concurrent reversetunnel agents per proxy endpoint.
